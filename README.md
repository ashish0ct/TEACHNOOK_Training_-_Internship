# Data Science Internship Project

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed during my Data Science internship. The project focuses on predicting machine failures using sensor data, employing various data science techniques and tools.

## Internship Structure

### Month 1: Training

During the first month, I received comprehensive training in essential data science concepts and tools:

- Python programming language
- Data Acquisition techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preparation and Cleaning
- Other relevant data science concepts

### Month 2: Project Implementation

In the second month, I worked on a practical project aimed at predicting machine failures using sensor data. The project involved:

- Analyzing a dataset containing sensor readings from various machines
- Implementing predictive models to forecast potential machine failures
- Visualizing data to uncover patterns and insights

## Project Details

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains:
- Sensor data collected from multiple machines
- Historical records of machine failures

### Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: For numerical computing
- Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- Scikit-learn (sklearn): For implementing machine learning models

### Key Visualizations

1. Correlation Matrix: To understand the relationships between different sensor readings
2. Failure Distribution: To visualize the frequency and patterns of machine failures
3. Pair Plot: To explore the relationships between multiple variables simultaneously

## Skills Acquired

Through this internship and project, I've gained proficiency in:

- Python programming for data science
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
